# 🖥️ My Portfolio

Hello! I am Błażej. Creating web applications is for me more than only job. It is my hobby and fantastic way for creative spending a free time. I love Laravel and WordPress, but I am open to learning new technologies. I realized solo projects and also in group. I can work in front-end and back-end. I know the basics of working in a Linux terminal. I can create technical documentation. I’m good in planning and realising my projects.

## 📚 My example projects:

**WordPress themes:**
- ([Vapautta](https://github.com/Angir777/vapautta))
- ([FortyFour](https://github.com/Angir777/fortyfour))
